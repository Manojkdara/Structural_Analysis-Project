# Structural_Analysis-Project
This simulation explores the deformation behavior of a metal safety barrier under impact loading using Ansys Workbench. A STEP-based CAD model representing a multi-rail guardrail was imported and prepared for analysis. Fixed support conditions were applied at the base of both vertical posts to simulate realistic anchoring to the ground.

A horizontal impact force was introduced at the mid-span of the top railâ€”mimicking a collision scenario such as a vehicle strike. The model was assigned material properties consistent with structural steel and meshed using a refined, automatic setup to ensure result accuracy near high-stress zones.
